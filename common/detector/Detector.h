/**
    \brief Interface for a DRace compatible race detector

    Premises for a implementation of a detector back-end:

    - Every thread starts with a initial call of fork()
    - There are no double forks of the same thread as child
    - A read or write will never contain a tid which was not forked
    - A read can happen before a write
    - A read and a write with the same TID will never arrive concurrently
    - A happens after may arrive before a corresponding happens before arrives
    - A lock may be be released, before it will be acquired
    - the last three bullet points must not cause a crash
